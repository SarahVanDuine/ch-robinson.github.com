Are you drowning in a sea of buzzwords: Agile, Digital Transformation, Microservice Architecture, Data Science,
Message Brokers, Open Source, Machine Learning, User-Centered Design, Cloud, DevOps, Streaming, Big Data, Observability,
Containerization; and wondering how to make sense of it all? Well the good news is you are not alone. We at
C.H. Robinson are also inundated with the same deluge of information.

C.H. Robinson is the original 3PL[^threePL]. In our industry, information must move at the speed of thought as we are entrusted by the
largest companies in the world to accelerate supply chain management within their business. Transportation and supply chain
management are undergoing a massive digital disruption. These disruptions coupled with the changing landscape of technology
have been a catalyst for an evolution at the very core of C.H. Robinson Information Technology. This evolution is re-defining
the way we deliver value to our customers.

We welcome you to explore with us via our Engineering Blog the IT experiments and evolution underway at C.H. Robinson as we
gear up for the digital age of supply chain management. Learn about our Agile journey and our engagement with the
[SD Learning Consortium](http://www.sdlearningconsortium.org/). We will look into how we have leveraged the power of
DevOps to evolve our architecture and improve our speed to market. We will demonstrate how User-Centered Design and
personalized insight provide easy to use and intuitive products. You will see how we can connect more deeply with our
customers through our Digitalization and [API First](https://developer.chrobinson.com/#/) designs.  We will take a look
at how we are providing our users and customers with more personal insights through Big Data and Data Science.

We will show you how we have taken advantage of this technology evolution to improve and expand our business capabilities:

   * [Navisphere&reg; Vision](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/navispherevision/) provides visibility into all of the
   sources of information about the global supply chain in one place.
   * [Navisphere&reg; Carrier](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/carriers/carrier-technology/navisphere-carrier-mobile-app/)
   for fleet management
   * [Navisphere&reg; Driver](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/newsroom/press-releases/2018/05-29-2018_ch-robinson-launches-navisphere-driver-app-in-europe/) to optimize the driver's experience.
   
"All work and no play make Jack a dull boy," and C.H. Robinson IT is no different.  So we will also take you on a tour
of our culture through our employee engagement efforts in CHAMPS[^CHAMPS].  Our investments in diversity and caring will be on
display through our sponsorship of WIT[^WIT] and yearly participation in
[Robinson Cares Week](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/about-us/chrobinson/corporate-responsibility/community/).
We will highlight how we infuse our teams with a spirit of fun and innovation with our annual Hackamania.

We will help you see things differently. Instead of a confusing landscape of buzzwords we will show you how to realize the
potential of emerging technologies to expand your own business capabilities.
